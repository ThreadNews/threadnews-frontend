      "I completely agree. The legal system and even all of government is so broken in this society and the only way that that is every going to change is if we band together and fight for the rights of the common people! Even more, the rights of those on the bottom of the social ladder! I want this country's least fortunate soul to still be better off than the top one percent in other countries! I have this vision for our country and I hope that you will all share it with me!",
